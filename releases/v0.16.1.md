## Bug fixes

### Remove v prefix from Docker tags [#164](https://github.com/grafana/xk6/issues/164)

Starting with `v0.15.0`, Docker images are built with goreleaser. A `v` prefix was accidentally added to the beginning of the Docker version tags. This has been fixed, and the Docker image version tags will no longer have the `v` prefix.
