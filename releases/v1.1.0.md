# Grafana xk6 v1.1.0 is here! ðŸŽ‰

## New Features

### `xk6 sync` command

Added a `sync` subcommand to synchronize extension dependencies with k6.

The command synchronizes the versions of dependencies in `go.mod` with those used in the k6 project. Dependencies not found in k6's `go.mod` remain unchanged. Future updates may include synchronization of other files.

The command was inspired by [`go-depsync`](https://github.com/grafana/go-depsync/) tool.
