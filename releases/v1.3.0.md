Grafana **xk6** `v1.3.0` is here! 🎉

This release introduces the `xk6 test` command for running integration tests during extension development, making it easier to validate k6 extensions with comprehensive test reporting.

## New Features

### Integration Testing: `xk6 test`

New command for running k6 integration tests during extension development ([#382](https://github.com/grafana/xk6/issues/382)). This command builds k6 with your extension once and runs multiple test scripts, reporting results in TAP (Test Anything Protocol) format by default or CTRF JSON (Common Test Report Format) with the `--json` flag.

  ```bash
  # Run tests with TAP output
  xk6 test tests/**/*.js
  
  # Generate CTRF JSON report
  xk6 test --json --out report.json tests/**/*.js
  ```

Supports:

- Enhanced error reporting with k6-specific exit codes (97-110) for detailed failure diagnostics. Exit codes include cloud test failures, threshold violations, timeouts, and script exceptions.

- Test file selection supports advanced glob patterns including `**` for recursive directory matching, `*` for wildcards, `?` for single characters, and `{a,b}` for alternatives.

- The `--k6` flag allows testing with a pre-built k6 binary instead of building from source, useful when the Go toolchain is unavailable.

- TAP format text output for easy integration with CI/CD systems or  CTRF (Common Test Report Format) support for structured test reporting.

## Dependency Updates

- Added dependencies for test command: `github.com/ctrf-io/go-ctrf-json-reporter` v0.0.15, `github.com/goreleaser/fileglob` v1.4.0
- Updated various dependencies based on Renovate pull requests
