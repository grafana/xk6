Grafana **xk6** `v1.2.1` is here! ðŸŽ‰

This is a patch release focusing on several minor fixes and improvements to the **`xk6 lint`** command and internal tooling for a smoother development experience.

### Fixes & Improvements

* **Consistent Environment Variable Handling:** `xk6 lint` now correctly treats **empty environment variables** (`export K6_VAR=""`) as if they were unset or non-existent. This ensures that environment variable logic is consistent with how CLI flags are handled, preventing unexpected overrides of default values.

* **Tooling Clarity:** The internal code generation utility, **`tools/presetter`**, has been renamed to the more accurate and generic **`tools/codegen`**. This resolves confusion, as the tool generates Go source code and documentation for checks *and* presets, not just presets.

* **Smarter Validation Workflow:** The **`versions` checker** has been disabled within the `xk6 lint` run in the shared **`extension-validate`** workflow. Since this workflow typically runs on Pull Requests (before a release is created), checking for final version tags was causing unnecessary failures.
