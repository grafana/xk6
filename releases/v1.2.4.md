Grafana **xk6** `v1.2.4` is here! 🎉

This release focuses on improving the developer experience with automated dependency management, better extension scaffolding, and enhanced linting capabilities. The project has migrated to Renovate for dependency updates and standardized on Go 1.25.x.

## Changes and Improvements

### Dependency Management

* **Renovate Integration:** Added comprehensive Renovate configuration for automated dependency updates. The configuration includes:
    * Custom regex managers to detect and update tool versions in GitHub workflows and devcontainer configurations
    * Automatic updates for golangci-lint, goreleaser, gosec, and govulncheck
    * Smart scheduling: daily updates for critical dependencies (Docker images, Go runtime, k6 ecosystem), weekly for standard dependencies
    * Intelligent grouping of related updates to minimize PR noise
    * Automatic Go module tidying and import path updates
* **Migrated to Renovate:** Replaced Dependabot with Renovate for improved dependency management.
* **Go Version Harmonization:** Standardized on Go 1.25.x across all workflows and development environments.

### `xk6 new` Command

* **Template File Exclusion:** Template repositories like `xk6-example` can now maintain template-specific files (such as `CODEOWNERS`, `renovate.json`) that are automatically excluded when scaffolding new extensions. This allows template maintainers to use modern development tools and workflows without polluting newly created projects with template-specific configuration.

### `xk6 lint` Enhancements

* **Fixed Build Check for SQL Driver Extensions:** The `build` linter check now correctly handles xk6-sql-driver-* extensions like `xk6-sql-driver-mysql`, `xk6-sql-driver-postgres`, etc.

### Documentation

* **Improved Navigation:** Check names and preset names in the linting documentation are now anchor links, making it easier to reference specific checks and presets.

### Workflow Improvements

* **Streamlined Validation:** Removed redundant zizmor security scanning job from the validation workflow.
* **Enhanced Go Image Tracking:** Enabled Renovate to automatically track and update the Go base image version.
