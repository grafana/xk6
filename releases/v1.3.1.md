Grafana **xk6** `v1.3.1` is here! 🎉

This release enhances the extension validation workflow with k6-based integration testing capabilities.

## New Features

### Integration Testing in Extension Validation

The `extension-validate` reusable workflow now supports running k6-based integration tests for extensions ([#395](https://github.com/grafana/xk6/pull/395)). Extension developers can specify test scripts using the new `xk6-test-pattern` input parameter, and the workflow will automatically execute them using the `xk6 test` command.

**Usage:**

```yaml
uses: grafana/xk6/.github/workflows/extension-validate.yml@v1.3.1
with:
  xk6-test-pattern: "test/**/*.js"
```

**Features:**

- Runs integration tests using the newly built xk6 binary
- Supports glob patterns for test file selection
- Generates TAP format test reports in GitHub Actions step summary
- Optional and backward compatible - only runs when `xk6-test-pattern` is provided

## Dependency Updates
