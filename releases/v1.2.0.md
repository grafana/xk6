Grafana **xk6** `v1.2.0` is here! ðŸŽ‰

This release introduces a major enhancement to the `xk6 lint` command with **check presets**, making it easier to validate k6 extensions for different use cases and environments. The linting system has been significantly improved with better documentation, flexible configuration options, and streamlined compliance workflows.

## BREAKING CHANGES

- **Grade system removal**: The compliance grading system (A-F scores) has been removed. Extensions now receive clear pass/fail results for each check instead of weighted scores.

## What's New

### Check Presets for xk6 lint

The `xk6 lint` command now supports **presets** - predefined sets of compliance checks tailored for different extension development scenarios:

- **`loose`** (default): Minimal preset focusing on essential quality and security checks, perfect for development environments
- **`strict`**: Comprehensive preset for production-ready extensions with all compliance checks except official Grafana-specific ones  
- **`all`**: Complete validation with every available check in the linting system
- **`private`**: Tailored for private/internal extensions used within organizations
- **`community`**: Optimized for community-maintained extensions published to public repositories
- **`official`**: Full compliance suite including Grafana-specific requirements like CODEOWNERS validation

### Enhanced Lint Command Interface

The `xk6 lint` command has been redesigned with improved flexibility:

```bash
# Use presets for common scenarios
xk6 lint --preset strict
xk6 lint --preset community

# Customize checks beyond presets
xk6 lint --preset private --enable security,vulnerability
xk6 lint --preset all --disable codeowners
xk6 lint --enable-only module,readme,license

# Get help on available options
xk6 lint checks    # List all available checkers
xk6 lint presets   # List all available presets
```

### Comprehensive Documentation Overhaul

All linting documentation has been significantly improved:

- **Consistent terminology**: Standardized use of "compliance" throughout the system
- **Detailed check descriptions**: Each checker now includes clear descriptions, rationales, and resolution guidance
- **Professional help content**: Improved CLI help text and embedded documentation
