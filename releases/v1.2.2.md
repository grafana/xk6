Grafana **xk6** `v1.2.2` is here! ðŸŽ‰

This small patch release fixes a critical issue with the exit code of the `xk6 lint` command. This bug was introduced in `v1.2.0`.

### Bug Fix

* **Corrected `xk6 lint` Exit Code:** The `xk6 lint` command now correctly returns a **non-zero exit code (e.g., `1`)** when one or more lint checks fail. Previously, the command always returned `0`, making it impossible for CI/CD pipelines (like GitHub Actions) to correctly detect linting failures and fail the build.
