Grafana **xk6** `v1.2.3` is here! 🎉

This small patch release focuses on improving the usability and robustness of the `xk6 lint` command, particularly for automated testing and CI/CD pipelines, and includes several dependency updates.

## Changes and Improvements

### `xk6 lint` Enhancements

* **Enhanced Exit Code Handling:** The command now provides three distinct exit codes for better CI/CD automation support:
    * **0:** All checks passed successfully.
    * **1:** Command execution error (invalid arguments, internal failure, etc.).
    * **2:** Linting completed but one or more checks failed. 
* **Decoupled Linter Checkers:** Linter checkers have been refactored to be fully independent of one another. This removes previous hidden dependencies, ensuring that any combination of checkers can be selected and run correctly without assuming a specific execution order or prior state.
* **Corrected Directory Argument Handling:** All linter checkers now run correctly when passed a directory argument. This fixes an issue where the `build` linter specifically failed to function properly if the provided directory path was relative.

## Dependency Updates

* Bumps **`securego/gosec`** from `2.22.9` to `2.22.10`.
* Bumps **`astral-sh/setup-uv`** from `7.0.0` to `7.1.0`.
* Bumps **`golang`** base image from `1.24.8-alpine3.22` to `1.24.9-alpine3.22`
